I boot up my laptop, feeling so keen,
Today I’ll master this Java machine.
“Hello, World!”—my first line, so proud,
Then forty red errors scream out loud.

“Public static void”—why’s it so picky?
These braces and brackets are feeling quite tricky.
I Google each error, down a rabbit hole,
Stack Overflow’s now devouring my soul.

NullPointerException? Oh, that sounds bad,
The program just crashed—this is driving me mad.
Loops that won’t loop, lists that won’t list,
How did coding turn into *this*?

My code won’t compile, I’ve smashed every key,
Did Java just *laugh*? Or is it just me?
One missing semicolon—I’m starting to cry,
Why does it hate me? I’m a really nice guy.

Hours go by, and I’ve learned one thing clear:
In Java, no coder escapes without fear.
But hey, if this compiles, I’ll do a dance,
Then start debugging… because there's no chance.
